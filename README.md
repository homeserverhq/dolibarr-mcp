# Dolibarr MCP Multitenant Proxy Server

This repository contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts
as a secure, multi-tenant proxy between an AI Assistant and the
Dolibarr ERP/CRM backend API. It exposes **299 MCP tools** covering
33 resource domains with full CRUD, lifecycle management, and
relationship management.

## ✨ Features

- **🔑 Identity Passthrough** — Extracts the `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  header from incoming HTTP requests and forwards it to the Dolibarr
  API without server-side authentication.
- **👥 Multi-Tenancy** — Uses Python `contextvars` to maintain thread-safe
  user identity isolation, ensuring all AI-driven actions are scoped to
  the authenticated user's permissions.
- **📊 Full Dolibarr Coverage** — 299 tools mapped to Dolibarr
  API endpoints across 33 resource domains.
- **⚡ TOON Optimization** — Bulk list responses are automatically compressed
  using TOON (Token-Optimized Object Notation) to reduce token consumption
  and maximize context window efficiency.
- **⚡ Efficient Gets** — GET responses return only commonly used fields by
  default. Full objects are available via an `include_all_fields` flag.
- **🧪 Comprehensive Testing** — 529 automated tests covering all tool
  domains, run via the test runner pipeline.

## 🔧 Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DOLIBARR_BASE_URL` | Yes | Docker-internal URL of the Dolibarr API |
| `MCP_SERVER_PORT` | Yes | Port number the MCP server listens on |
| `ALLOW_ALL_AGGREGATE` | No | When `true`, aggregate listing tools honor the `include_all_fields` parameter. When `false` (default), the parameter is silently forced to `False` for aggregate list operations. |
| `IS_STATEFUL` | No | When `true`, uses stateful Streamable HTTP with session tracking. When `false` (default), uses stateless mode. |

## 📦 Installation & Local Development

1. Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed.
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install fastmcp httpx pydantic uvicorn toon-mcp-server
    ```
3. Run the server:
    ```bash
    export DOLIBARR_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8040/api/index.php
    export MCP_SERVER_PORT=80
    python -m src.main
    ```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Build and run the server using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t dolibarr-mcp:latest .
docker run -d --name dolibarr-mcp \
    -e DOLIBARR_BASE_URL="http://dolibarr-app:80/api/index.php" \
    -e MCP_SERVER_PORT=80 \
    dolibarr-mcp:latest

The MCP server serves at `http://dolibarr-mcp:80/mcp`
(Streamable HTTP).
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **📋 `include_all_fields`** — The `include_all_fields` parameter (available
  on all `get_*` and `list_*` tools) controls whether all available fields
  are included in responses. Defaults to `False` for performance; set to
  `True` only when additional fields are needed.
- **⚡ TOON Compression** — All bulk list responses are automatically
  compressed using TOON (Token-Optimized Object Notation) to reduce token
  consumption by 30-60%.
- **📝 Required Fields & Defaults** — Each `create_*` tool requires specific
  key fields (e.g. `name` for third parties). All other fields default to
  empty strings or reasonable values. The owner/user assignment field is
  automatically set to the authenticated user for most resources.
